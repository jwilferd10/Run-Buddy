This is the landing page of a fitness platform called Run Buddy, these pages showcase a fitness company that is promoting their platform and trying to sell their services as physical trainers. Built for both desktop and mobile devices. This is the companies digital footprint.

### üí≠ Developer Notes
The foundational framework for Run Buddy was established at commit 6293801. Subsequent changes made beyond this commit are my personal updates. These commits are primarily aimed to modernize the platform. Notable improvements include:

- Replacement of lorem ipsum filler with detailed paragraphs 
- Evolution of the design, moving away from the 'boxed in' layout
- Strategic emphasis placed on key elements to capture user attention. 
- Animations for specific images
- Improved mobile experience

These enhancements enable Run Buddy to effectively engage with it's audience and learn more about the platform. 

### üôè Thank You
Especially for checking out Run Buddy, I consider this a stepping stone as it is the first landing page I've built.
