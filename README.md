Run Buddy is a website that was created as a journey to learn HTML and CSS structure. This project was built from the ground-up without the assistance of any Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Featured within this repository is well-written and semantic HTML with reusable CSS assets used throughout the entirety of the project. The two HTML files featured in this repository are both the landing and privacy-policy page.

The foundational framework for Run Buddy was established at commit 6293801. Subsequent changes made beyond this milestone represent additional enhancements implemented to refine the initial setup. These updates primarily aimed to modernize the platform. Notable improvements include the replacement of lorem ipsum filler with detailed paragraphs, the evolution of the design to eliminate the initial 'boxed in' layout, and the strategic emphasis placed on key elements to capture user attention. These enhancements enable Run Buddy to effectively engage with it's audience and learn more about Run Buddy.
